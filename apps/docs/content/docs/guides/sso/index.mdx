description: Integrate Single Sign-On (SSO) effortlessly into your application.

Single Sign-On simplifies the user experience by allowing access to multiple systems with a single authentication process. It also improves security by reducing the number of passwords a user needs to remember.

## Supported SSO providers

VitNode provides a build-in way to integrate Single Sign-On (SSO) in your application for:

- [Google](/docs/guides/sso/google)
- [Facebook](/docs/guides/sso/facebook)
- [Custom SSO](/docs/dev/sso)

Choose one of the providers and follow the guide to integrate it into your application.

## How it works

1. The user clicks on the SSO button.
2. The user is redirected to the SSO provider's login page.
3. The user logs in.
4. The user is redirected back to your application with a token.
5. Your application verifies the token and logs in the user.

## Custom SSO

If your application isn't on the list, you can create a custom SSO provider by following the [Custom SSO for Dev](/docs/dev/sso) guide.
