VitNode allows you to create your own plugin with own API endpoints and views. This is a powerful feature that allows you to extend the functionality of your application and share it with others.

## API Plugin

```ts title="plugins/{name_plugin}/src/api/plugin.ts"
import { createPluginApi } from 'vitnode/api/helpers/plugin';

export const corePlugin = createPluginApi({
  name: 'core',
  modules: [],
});
```
