description: Provide a way to get access to the translation strings in client components on frontend.
---

By default VitNode provide a way to get access to the translation strings only for `core.global` namespace. But sometimes you need to get access to the translation strings in other namespaces.

For example, you have a component that needs to get access to the translation strings in the `core.global` and `welcome.home` namespaces.

<Callout title="Client Component Only">
  Provide namespaces into components is only for client components. If you want
  to use translation strings in server components you can avoid this guide.
</Callout>

## Structuring

To translate your content, select the plugin in `frontend` folder, go to `langs` folder and pick the language you want to translate.

```json title="apps/frontend/src/plugins/{your_plugin}/langs/en.json"
{
  "{your_plugin}": {
    "home": {
      "hello": "Hello World",
      "world": "World"
    }
  }
}
```

<Callout title="Primary key" type="warn">
  Name your plugin should be a primary key in the JSON file or with the prefix `admin_` for admin plugins.

```json title="apps/frontend/src/plugins/{your_plugin}/langs/en.json"
{
  "{your_plugin}": {
    "hello": "Hello World" // ✅ This will work
  },
  "admin_{your_plugin}" {
    "world": "World" // ✅ This will work
  },
  "world": "World" // ❌ This will not work
}
```

</Callout>

## Usage

To get access to the translation strings in other namespaces you need to use the `TranslationsProvider` component.

```tsx title="apps/frontend/src/app/[locale]/(main)/{your_plugin}/layout.tsx"
import { TranslationsProvider } from 'vitnode-frontend/components/translations-provider';

export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <TranslationsProvider namespaces={['welcome.home']}>
      {children}
    </TranslationsProvider>
  );
}
```

Provide the list of namespaces that you want to get access to the translation strings in the `namespaces` prop.

<Callout title="Global namespace">
  You don't need to include the `core.global` namespace in the `namespaces`
  prop. It's already included by default.
</Callout>
